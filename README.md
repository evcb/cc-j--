# Overview

This repository contains a modified version of the most up-to-date _j--_ base compiler and
additional information for the textbook, _Introduction to Compiler
Construction in a Java World_ by Bill Campbell, Swami Iyer, and 
Bahar Akbal-Deliba&#351;, which is a non-trivial subset of the Java&trade;
programming language. The compiler is organized in an object-oriented style.
Although most compilers are not written this way, they decided to organize it
this way because you will most likely be programming in an object-oriented style.

This project is created for the 02247 Compiler Construction course project from
the Technical University of Denmark, spring 2021.
